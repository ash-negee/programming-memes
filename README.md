# or
yarn start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Integration

The app uses the Programming Memes API from RapidAPI. The API configuration is set up in the `App.tsx` file:

```typescript
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  url: 'https://programming-memes-images.p.rapidapi.com/v1/memes',
  headers: {
    'x-rapidapi-key': process.env.REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY,
    'x-rapidapi-host': 'programming-memes-images.p.rapidapi.com'
  }
};
```

## Features Explanation

### Timer System
- The app implements a 65-second timer between meme loads
- The timer automatically resets when new memes are loaded
- Users can manually load more memes once the timer reaches zero

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading state indicators

### UI Components
- Responsive image display
- Bootstrap-based styling
- Loading and error state buttons
- Clean and minimal interface
